# 106A Final Project: Stopping Robot
## 1. Introduction

The end goal of our project was to be able to stop a moving object using Baxter as before it reached the end of its trajectory. Our project consistently stopped objects moving on a conveyor belt at variable speeds with a cup. In order to accomplish such reliability, we had to solve three interesting problems: how to translate from a pixel captured by a camera to world frame; getting accurate velocity predictions; and being able to always find motion plans. Upon accomplishing this, we would be able to move on to stopping rolling objects, stopping one out of many objects, or even grasping and picking up the object. The problems that we need to solve in order to do all of this include being able to identify an object and distinguish it from its background or other objects with computer vision, determine its velocity and an intercept point along its trajectory to send the Baxter arm to, and then actually move the Baxter arm to intercept the object without missing. This project has many real-world applications, from assembly line robots that have to interact with objects moving along a conveyor belt to robots that could intercept and catch falling or thrown objects.
